##### Lead Off
We see a small bird flying through the lower sections of a giant manmade mountain traversing through massive caverns and tight tunnels. Hearing the clanging of metal on anvils and the firing of forges, ducking and weaving over workers and automotons finishing their business day and heading toward evening revilaries. 

The bird continues their flight over haphazard buidlings thrown together hastily until they come to a large wall where they begin to ascend higher and higher until they crest the top of wall. Looking out we see an area of densely populated towering structures start to rise into the sky and hear the cacophany of the people of Sharn. There are a number of various markets offering delcectable smelling food, dazzling clothing, and bright beautiful magic. The structure of the buildings improves from those below the large wall, with towers made of beautiful well kept limestones rising from large buildings standing between the different markets and residential areas spread out. There are also massive bridges spanning out in all directions connecting these gorgeous spires to one another, some more precarious than others. Suddenly we see a individual lose their footing on one such bridge and fall suddenly from a disasterous height. However, upon futher inspection it is not as disasterous as it appears to be when the person's descent starts to slow until they appear to be floating slowy towards another building. 

Our little bird continues its flight throughout the city ignoring the dropped food of citizens visiting street vendors in favor of persuing a specific goal. They meet another large wall where they again start to head up flying parallel to the wall moving higher and higher and higher  gaining more and more speed until they finally reach the top where another set of towers rise into the night sky. These towers are more scarse compared to the previous Middle Section of the city. However, what they lack in quality they make up for in qaulity. Our littler bird moves quickly weaving in and out of beautiful towers made of glass, obsidan, steels, and stone. These buildings are beautifully crafted and there are notciably less people in this section of the city but there is an ever present noise of giant skyships moving in and out of the giant skyport sat at the very top of the various towers witin the the Upper City. Finally this little bird comes to a massive building with a glass dome and a huge balcony where they see a large number of people moving in and out of three beautifully crafted wooden doors. The people appear to be dressed in gorgeous costumes and masks when the bird we have been following descends down quickly rocketing through the doors and circling the inside the glass dome. As they circle a few attendees begin to notice the bird who seems to be growing in size and the very perceptive begin to seem the birds wings begin to smoke and all of a sudden catch flame and as the flames continue to grow and grow until an inferno circles the dome the bird crashes down into the center of the ballroom under this dome. Except before where we saw a firey bird now we see a tall elf with fire red hair dressed in beautiful gold holding their hands out and saying "Welcome one and all to the Festival of Wildnight, a night to celebrate the hard work and toiling of our brave citizens of Sharn and recognize Fury the god of Passion. Please give your thanks to tonights sponsors of this event the Prince of Breland INSERT NAME and the Twelve Dragonmarked Houses.  Make merry, feast, and please enjoy the festivities."

A band starts to play a loud tune for dancing and automotons make their way around the party serving appitizers and drinks.
