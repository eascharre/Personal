## History
**Short**: Ebberon is a world teeming with magic, adevtenure, and most importantnly dragons. It is a prison world in the Material Plane.

#### Ancient History
**Long**: When the [[Material Plane]] was created there were 3 dragons who breathed life into the realms. The three dragons were [[Khyber]], [[NPCs/Progenitor Dragons/Eberron]], and [[Siberys]]. They created all things within with the agreement that the three of them would not interfer. However, [[Khyber]] grew bored with their agreement and sought sole dominion over all the realms. Before a battle could even begin, [[Khyber]] struck down [[Siberys]] and tore him apart. Enraged [[NPCs/Progenitor Dragons/Eberron]] wrestled [[Khyber]] and bound the traitor with the coils of her tail, but could not bring herself to destroy the once beloved [[Khyber]]. And so [[Eberron]] became a  a living prison, a world that could contain [[Khyber]]'s greed and evil. Or so the legends say.

#### Modern Era
The continent of [[Khorvaire]] once ruled by the mighty family Galifar. It flourished under an age of wise rulers and noble warriors. This all ended with the death of last Galifar King, King Jarot 100 years ago. The Last War ensued fighting over who would be the new ruler. The war only just recently ended 5 years ago with the Treaty of Thronehold spliting the former united continent into several nations.
