## Aundair: The Lap of Luxury

#### Brief Overview
Although much of its western forest territory has now become the Eldeen Reaches, Aundair still possesses beautiful swaths of fertile fields that supply the nations of [[Khorvaire]] with food and fine wines, while large institutions of higher learning output scholars and knowledge.

#### Capital City
Thaliost, Aundair's former capital and the cradle of its culture was occupied by [[Thrane]] in The Last War. Much to the displeasure of Aundairian people, the Treaty of Thronehold left it in Thrane's possession.
