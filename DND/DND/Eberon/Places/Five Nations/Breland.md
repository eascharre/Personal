# Breland: The New Heart of Khorvaire

#### Brief
Breland is a mix of open farmland, woodland, and sprawling metropolises, the largest and most famous of which is [[Sharn, City of Towers]]. The Lighting Raile originates out of Sharn and from there travels across[[Breland]] and out to the other nations of [[Khorvaire]], while House Orien roadways branch out to more remote locations among the countryside.
