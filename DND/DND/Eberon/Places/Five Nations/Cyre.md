## The Former Nation of Cyre

#### History 
Once one of the Five Nations, Cyre is now called the Mourningland. Cyre was once the heart of [[Khorvaire]] and as such was the battleground for most of the Last War. 

**Destrcution**:
Many events lead to the dectructions of the nation. While the accounts vary because of how few survivors there were of the Battle of Saerun neighboring villages recall a blinding white light and an ensuing slience. In Metrol, the former capital of Cyre, there were reports of a dead-gray mist that rose up around the capital and engulfed the entire nation. Anyone in the mist that day died and the bodies were horrifically transformed. 

**The Mist**:
The Mist srrounds a land of wild magic, acting as a bandage around an open wound. Make no mistake the nation of Cyre is nothing more now than an open mass grave. The Mournland is filled with magical effects and monsters. Some say that there have been sightings of people in walking through the mist. Other say they can hear noises of strange beats and a constant beating reverberates around the entire nation.
