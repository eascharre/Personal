#### Background
His biological parents died during the Last War leaving him ==orphaned== at a young age. A distant ancestor of his was a fire genasi, but multiple generations have passed and with each generation the connection to the element fire faded away to the point were the only connection that remained was a reddish tint to the skin.

He was adopted and raised by water genasi couple living in Sharm who both worked at the ==docks/sailors== (not sure if there is fishing, but if there is then they would be fishers). They recognized his genasi ancestry and wanted to give him a home where he would be protected from ridicule growing up for his differences. He greatly appreciates all that his adopted parents did for him and loves them deeply. Late in his youth he did start to notice a growing connection to fire that developed into powers close to what his late ancestors would have been able to do. Although he did value these new skills with fire, he still longed for a stronger connection with water hoping it would help him feel even closer to his loving adopted parents. Being raised by them ignited an interest and wanting for a connection with water but realizing this would not be possible he instead started to tinker (aka Artificer) with things to try and artificially become connected to the water element, but so far with little success but he continues to try. He currently lives by himself performing odd handyman jobs where he can use his tinkering skills to make a living.
