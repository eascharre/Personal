##### Background
Bartleby is a warforged created by commission of the Sharn public library to curate their books and act as a guide to the knowledge contained there. He has spent his 10 years of life reading and learning from all the library has to offer. Motivated by visits from travelers and his desire to know more about the outside world, Bartleby plans to abandon his post and seek knowledge elsewhere.
