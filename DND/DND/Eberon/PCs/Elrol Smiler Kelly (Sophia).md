#### Background
Elrol’s great great grandmother was a poison dragon who got busy with her human great greatgrandfather (she was in a human form), and they had some kids. The kids were green dragonborn, and as a blessing from their mother the children would pass on the same vibrant green hue of their scales to their children. They raised their kids well and she taught them about all kinds of poisons, she was a botany enthusiast, among other things. She warned them how to recognize it in teas and breads, she showed them how to brew different kinds.

She also taught them about radium–where they could find it and dig it and what it was capable of. Dragons do love naturally occurring riches. She warned them of it’s dangers–great power comes with great knowledge–but when the great great grandfather passed away and the kids were adults sufficient on their own, she left. Her only other option would have been to watch her kids and their kids die. To maintain the family’s hoard, the eldest son went into war profiteering. 

The family had an awful streak of greed, and he carefully ignored the warnings of his mother. He hired dwarves to mine the ore, people to run refineries, and began selling it to everyone from artists to fighters. Artificers used it in their war forged, bards used it because it glowed beautifully, fighters used it as war paint, rogues &amp; rangers as a quiet light source. He knew it’s capabilities and its dangers, and his secret to his grand success was that he never hailed himself as a great inventor or war hero. He garnered money sitting quietly and selling it to manufacturers, never directly to the public.

Though old money often sniffs at new money, they respect that “anyone can pull themselves up by their bootstraps”, and rich people know better than to look into how other rich people became rich (especially during wartimes), and so no one questioned this new wealthy family as they entered high society. The company was handed down through familial generations. Throughout time there were some issues with dwarves and other people discovering… adverse side effects, but complaints were
settled quietly and those subsidiaries shut down. These days, the Kelly’s company operates under the name “Eberron Radium” and mostly sells to artificers. When they need to act publicly, the company advocates for radium as a “clean energy source”. They have a boring logo on purpose, people tend to glance over their name. (They’re like one of those companies that made a breakthrough in some obscure microcontroller technology. No one ever really pays mind, they’re famous to a niche group, and filthy rich. When necessary they pass themselves off as a family business, not a dynasty.)

Despite the family’s dark history, they kept the traditions of their great great grandparents alive by raising them well, and teaching each new generation of children a passion for… botany. You don’t need to be a good person to be a good parent, after all, and each child was loved and cared for in all the ways they should be.

Elrol doesn’t know the dark side of her family’s money. If she learned about it, her first instinct would likely be to excuse it somehow. She does know enough, however, to not talk about her family’s business
too much. She is not aware enough to recognize her own elitism. Rich bitch (she’s not a bitch but you know). She grew up privileged, both as a higher class heir and with a healthy family dynamic. Her mother is on the board of Eberron Radium and is being groomed to be the next CEO, several years in the future. Elrol knows how to get what she wants: all she has to do is smile winningly and ask nicely.
