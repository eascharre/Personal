##### Background
The group that I am a part of is a private group that is top secret, we get contracted out by the authorities to go into undercover operations in the city. Changelings are sought out as young children to join this group, the group watches potential members with a certain criteria of skills - whether investigation, fighting, stealth, science, etc. Once a child is chosen, the group adopts them from their family, for a fair price. The child starts training immediately and starts getting requested missions at age 13, they can choose to go or continue to train. Our monastery, 'The Fading Spire', is located at the top of one of the mountain near Sharn. There is a secret path that only the monks, 'The Spired', know, our campus is temperature regulated so that we never get too cold or hot and can always train. Changelings are highly favored for the undercover operations since they can naturally disguise themselves. There are some older spired who are out on deep undercover missions; part of the mafia, drug cartel, etc. who had started when they were children. There are protocols before going out on missions, get a very rare Barrier tattoo and a lifewell tattoo.
