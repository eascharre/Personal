##### Background

Before Khorvaire split into independent nations, the patriarchs of her family served as advisors to the Galifar kings for generations. Eventually, they craved power of their own. In the years leading up to King Jarot’s death, her father began forming secretive political alliances with the king’s enemies to usurp power (not necessarily for himself, but for whoever seemed the most easily influenced). When this was discovered, he was executed, and the rest of the family was exiled from the capitol city. They fled to Sharn, where they started a new life among the city’s lower classes. She remembers her early years in the palace well, but she’s learned quite a bit about Sharn’s hiding spots in 100 years.

##### Motivators:
Justice, but only if it’s determined by her. As the child of a family fallen from grace, she is painfully aware of how one man’s selfishness can ruin the lives of thousands. But having grown up in poverty and war, she also understands that people are forced to do immoral things to survive. She’s more than willing to use her skill set for either purpose, so long as it stands to benefit her.
