# Siberys: The Forgotten Cosmic Being

#### Brief: 
The Middle Dragon of the Three Cosmics Dragons. Currently believed to be deceased, but there are rumors that a gorwing force in what used to be [[Cyre]] has been brewing.

#### Physical Description: 
So little is known about Siberys that they take on many shapes when stories are told. The most common interpretation is that they are silver in nature but had a penchant for mischeif as well.

#### Mechanics: 
Siberys can bestow magic on certain individuals in some of the following ways:
	- Cleric
	- Warlock
	- Paladin
	- Sorcerer
Any Dragonborns can also take the Commune spell but they can only speak to Siberys on [[Eberron, Place]].
