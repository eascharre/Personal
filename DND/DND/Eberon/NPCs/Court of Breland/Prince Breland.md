Â Kor ir'Wynarn is the second oldest of 11 children the previous heir passed at the end of the war (one of the leading reasons [[Breland]] pushed for a Treaty). He feels personally responsibile for the death of his oldest sister because he did not go to war.

Goals: Establish trade routes with other nations, ease tensions between [[Cogs]]/[[Lower Menthis]] and [[Upper Tavrick's Landing]], rid the city of the crime lords starting with the [[Boromar Clan]].

Reasons to be at the Ball:
1. Make relations between lower sections of the city and the upper sections of the city better.
2. Recruit people for his staff and to complete his missions
